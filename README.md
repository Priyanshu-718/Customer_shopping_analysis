CUSTOMER PURCHASE ANALYSIS – DATA ANALYST PROJECT

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. The objective is to convert raw customer data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, structured querying, and interactive dashboard visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
• Clean and preprocess raw customer data using Python
• Store and analyze data using MySQL
• Perform exploratory and descriptive analysis
• Visualize insights using Power BI dashboards
• Identify patterns and trends in customer behavior

DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset used in this project contains customer shopping behavior information. It includes customer demographics, purchase details, and transaction-related attributes such as:
• Age
• Gender
• Location
• Product Category
• Season of Purchase
• Purchase Frequency
• Ratings
• Subscription Status
• Purchase Amount

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
• Programming Language: Python
• Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
• Database: MySQL
• Visualization Tool: Power BI
• IDE: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING (PYTHON)
The following data cleaning steps were performed using Python:
• Removed duplicate records
• Handled missing and null values
• Standardized column names
• Corrected data types for numerical and categorical fields
• Prepared clean data for database storage and analysis

DATABASE AND SQL ANALYSIS (MYSQL)
After cleaning, the dataset was imported into MySQL. SQL queries were used to:
• Calculate total customers and total purchase amount
• Analyze purchase frequency by category and location
• Segment customers based on subscription status
• Compute average customer ratings
• Group and aggregate data using GROUP BY, WHERE, CASE, and aggregate functions

POWER BI DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize insights and KPIs. The dashboard includes the following key metrics:

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
• Total Customers: 4,000
• Average Rating: 3.75
• Total Purchase Amount: 233,000
• Subscribed Customers: 1,000
• Unsubscribed Customers: 3,000

VISUAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED
• Count of items purchased by age
• Purchase distribution by product category
• Seasonal purchase trends
• Gender-wise customer distribution
• Location-wise purchase frequency
• Subscription status comparison

KEY INSIGHTS
• Clothing is the most purchased category
• Spring season records the highest number of purchases
• A majority of customers are not subscribed
• Purchase frequency varies significantly across age groups
• Certain locations show higher purchasing consistency
